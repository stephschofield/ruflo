## Running the Tests

### Run all integration tests
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Run specific test file
```bash
npm run test -- v3/__tests__/integration/memory-integration.test.ts
npm run test -- v3/__tests__/integration/swarm-integration.test.ts
npm run test -- v3/__tests__/integration/mcp-integration.test.ts
npm run test -- v3/__tests__/integration/plugin-integration.test.ts
npm run test -- v3/__tests__/integration/workflow-integration.test.ts
```

### Run with coverage
```bash
npm run test:coverage -- v3/__tests__/integration
```

### Watch mode for development
```bash
npm run test:watch -- v3/__tests__/integration
```

## Test Architecture

### Mocking Strategy
- **External Dependencies**: Mocked (file system, network)
- **Module Interactions**: Real (test actual integration)
- **Database**: In-memory SQLite for tests
- **Event Bus**: Real EventEmitter for event testing

### Test Isolation
- Each test file creates fresh instances
- Database files are created with unique timestamps
- Cleanup in `afterEach` hooks
- No shared state between tests

### Performance Considerations
- Tests use in-memory databases when possible
- Concurrent operations tested with realistic timeouts
- Cleanup is non-blocking where safe

## CI/CD Integration

These integration tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:
- Fast execution (<5 minutes total)
- Reliable (deterministic, no flaky tests)
- Isolated (no external dependencies)
- Self-cleaning (automatic cleanup)

## Debugging Integration Tests

### Enable verbose logging
```bash
DEBUG=claude-flow:* npm run test:integration
```

### Run single test
```bash
npm run test -- -t "should execute end-to-end agent workflow"
```

### Generate detailed coverage report
```bash
npm run test:coverage -- v3/__tests__/integration --reporter=html
```

## Contributing

When adding new integration tests:
1. Follow the existing structure (15 tests per file)
2. Test real module interactions (not just mocks)
3. Include setup and teardown
4. Add meaningful descriptions
5. Update this README with new test coverage
